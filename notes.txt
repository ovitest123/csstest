fix bulma accordion css

reference css component versions - uikit v3 - in popover when hovering logo

have a mode where the user can select a framework, select a component, and construct that component - width and so on
can then build multiple components and compare them, can add icons to buttons etc - will have to download specific scripts for this

try to use css asset files so you can lazy load them
statistics should include size and github popularity
think about having loading placeholders when the images are loading up for cards

when an alert close button doesn't work - have a toaster message appear to say that this functionality is not provided out of the box

make the panels order switchable via options popover or drag and drop
